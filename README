Calise (beta)

Calise (acronym for Camera Light Sensor) is a lightweight program that uses any v4l2 compatible camera as a light sensor: obtains ambient brightness and calculates correct backlight setting according to a user-defined scale.
For simple usage instructions type "calise --help" or "calised --help" and for a detailed explanation please refer to man page.

What's calise?
Calise is a program written in python (with 2 C-python modules) that reads frames from a camera, computes ambient brightness value and sets backlight accordingly.
Main program (executable filename "calise") grabs the camera for the whole execution and grantes really high fidelity computations, BUT should not be used in background - like a daemon for example - because, despite cpu time usage is low ~1%, it causes too much wakeups.
On the other hand from release 0.1.0 there's also a "service" version (executable "calised") that, with the help of dawn/sunset times and weather informations optimizes captures as described below (and of course service's cpu time usage and power consumption are actually negligible):
    dawn/sunset: more or less from 1 to 7 captures per minute (according to latitude)
    daytime: from 60 to 12 captures per hour (according to weather informations taken once per hour, if no internet or weather info disaled 20)
    night: no captures
Anyway "service" version has also the capability of "manual" captures if the value returned by automatic execution is not good enough.
Take a look to man pages of both programs to get further informations.
Also, a really detailed wiki on calise installation, configuration and execution is up on calise site:

Setup Instructions and dependencies:
Please refer to INSTALL file from this same directory


Notes:
On the first run the program will start calibration to compile the default profile (so for that first time you have to run on terminal), then you can add other profiles giving the switch --calibrate to the program.
There has to be at least one "default" profile in the config dir, if not, the program will calibrate to get one.
To use a custom profile (not default), give the --profile <name> switch to the program.
Once a profile is created, you can modify it adding (but not removing) options. Take a look at config/sample.conf for all available options, btw the ones provided through calibration should suffice


Translations:
Currently there is only (partial) italian translation, but anyone is encouraged to make his/her own language translation.
"Service" version is currently not translated at all.
